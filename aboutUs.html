                        The market is today is flooded with bikes that claim to match visual appeal and high performance.

                        But only a true bike enthusiast knows what finding the right match means. Being bike lovers

                        ourselves, a group of engineers and designers set out to work together to build bikes that were both

                        functional as well as visually appealing, thereby creating a lasting impression – be it on the rider or

                        the onlooker.

                        As a team, we focus on one core ideology that of ‘form’ and ‘function’ working in unison. Every

                        product that we create inarguably imbibes this theory.

                        Our company is an amalgamation of thousands of hours of research, hundreds of tests and

                        numerous blue prints, all in an effort to correctly understand the pulse of the target market. Our

                        focus however will always be to ensure that our bikes match up to the world class quality expected

                        of it. What we make will inevidently endure harsh conditions and even tougher terrains, but the real

                        test of our bikes lie in its survival through it all. A stringent quality control mechanism thereby

                        ensures that our sale like our word is backed by a solid warranty.

                        Our goal is to build bikes that not only focus on fitness but are also capable performers on and off

                        road. Our emphasis will always remain to continue our support beyond just the purchase. It is

                        important for us that you enjoy the experience of riding our bikes as much as we loved building it for

                        you.

                        Our road trip has just about begun and we are delighted to have you join this long, adventurous ride.

                        Happy Tripping!
